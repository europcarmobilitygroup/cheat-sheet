Cheat Sheet LaTeX template

# How to use the template
Template is created using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) - a software/system for creading documentation.

Repository contains a `template.tex`, as well as assets and `.cls` file with all the available variables, packages and settings. 

Because LaTeX is only a source code, it needs to be compiled, and to do it, one needs the complete system installed on the local machine OR use freely available, online tools, such as [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

# Usage with overleaf
  - Clone the repository
  - Navigate to [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
  - Create free account or login if you have one
  - Click `New project` and select `Upload project`
  - Select `cheatsheet.zip`

Now your projct is imported and created in [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
Once opened, it's ready to edit and develop.
